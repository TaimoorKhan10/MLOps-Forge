# MLOps-Forge Architecture

This document outlines the architecture of the MLOps-Forge framework, including its components, data flow, and deployment strategy.

## Overview

The MLOps-Forge framework is designed as a comprehensive machine learning operations platform that supports the full lifecycle of ML models, from data ingestion to production monitoring.

## Components

### 1. Data Pipeline

The data pipeline is responsible for:
- Data ingestion from various sources
- Data validation and quality checks
- Feature engineering
- Feature store integration
- Data versioning

**Key Classes:**
- `DataLoader`: Handles data loading from different sources
- `FeatureEngineer`: Performs feature transformations
- `DataValidator`: Validates data quality

### 2. Model Training

The model training component:
- Trains ML models using various algorithms
- Performs hyperparameter tuning
- Tracks experiments with MLflow
- Evaluates model performance
- Registers models in the model registry

**Key Classes:**
- `ModelTrainer`: Trains and evaluates models
- `ExperimentTracker`: Integrates with MLflow for experiment tracking

### 3. API Layer

The API layer:
- Serves model predictions via RESTful API
- Validates input data
- Handles authentication and authorization
- Provides documentation via Swagger/OpenAPI

**Key Components:**
- FastAPI application
- Prediction endpoints
- Health check endpoints
- Model metadata endpoints

### 4. Monitoring

The monitoring system:
- Tracks model performance in production
- Detects data drift
- Monitors system health
- Triggers alerts on predefined thresholds

**Key Components:**
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization
- Custom metrics for ML-specific monitoring

### 5. CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline automates:
- Code testing
- Model validation
- Docker image building
- Kubernetes deployment

**Key Components:**
- GitHub Actions workflow
- Test automation
- Docker build pipeline
- Kubernetes manifests

## Data Flow

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Raw data is loaded from source systems
   - Data is validated for quality and completeness
   - Metadata is recorded

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Raw data is transformed into features
   - Features are standardized/normalized
   - Feature statistics are computed and stored

3. **Model Training**
   - Features are used to train models
   - Experiments are tracked in MLflow
   - Best models are registered in the model registry

4. **Model Deployment**
   - Selected models are deployed via the CI/CD pipeline
   - Models are containerized with Docker
   - Containers are deployed to Kubernetes

5. **Inference**
   - Requests come in via API
   - Preprocessing is applied
   - Model makes predictions
   - Postprocessing formats the response

6. **Monitoring**
   - Predictions are logged
   - Performance metrics are collected
   - Alerts are triggered based on thresholds

## Deployment Architecture

The system is deployed on Kubernetes with the following components:

1. **Application Tier**
   - API service (with autoscaling)
   - Batch processing jobs

2. **Data Tier**
   - Databases for metadata
   - Object storage for datasets and artifacts

3. **Monitoring Tier**
   - Prometheus server
   - Grafana dashboards
   - Alert manager

4. **MLOps Tools**
   - MLflow server
   - Model registry
   - Experiment tracking

## Security Considerations

- API authentication using JWT tokens
- Secrets management using Kubernetes secrets
- Network policies for pod-to-pod communication
- RBAC for Kubernetes resource access

## Scalability

The system scales horizontally through:
- Kubernetes horizontal pod autoscaling
- Distributed training support
- Queue-based batch processing
- Efficient resource utilization

## Next Steps

1. Implement A/B testing framework
2. Add automated retraining pipeline
3. Enhance monitoring with more ML-specific metrics
4. Implement advanced drift detection algorithms
